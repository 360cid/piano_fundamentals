Liszt’s Teaching Bibliography:
------------------------------

Below is a list containing information on Liszt’s teachings; the contents are
disappointing. Liszt’s father, Adam, did a terrific job of teaching Liszt but,
after soaring to fame, Liszt only gave “master classes” to students who were
already concert pianists, while complaining about the conservatories that could
not teach. The few teachers who knew how to teach were the parents of Mozart,
Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, etc. That tells us something valuable. The anointed
teachers: the great Masters and their students were led astray by the grandeur
of “talent”, dogma, endless practice, etc., (instead of research, knowledge,
documentation, empowerment, etc.) and piano pedagogy ended up in a dead end
with no way out.

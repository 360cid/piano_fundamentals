5. Practice the Difficult Sections First
----------------------------------------

Returning to *FÃ¼r Elise*, there are two difficult sections with 16 and 23 bars.
Start by practicing the most difficult sections first. These will take the
longest time to learn, so they should be given the most practice time. Since
the ending of most pieces is generally the most difficult, you will learn most
pieces starting from the end. Therefore, we will start by tackling these two
difficult sections.

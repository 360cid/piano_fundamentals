8. Continuity Rule
-------------------

When practicing one segment, always include the beginning of the following
segment. This continuity rule ensures that when you have learned two adjacent
segments, you can also play them together. It applies to any segment you
isolate for practice, such as a bar, an entire movement, or even to segments
smaller than a bar. A generalization of the continuity rule is that any passage
may be broken up into short segments for practice, but these segments must
overlap. The overlapping note or group of notes is called the conjunction. If
you are practicing the end of the first movement, then include a few bars of
the beginning of the second movement. During a recital, you will be glad that
you had practiced in this way; otherwise, you might suddenly find yourself
stumped on how to start the 2nd movement!

We can now apply the continuity rule to those difficult interruptions in *FÃ¼r
Elise*. To practice bar 53, add the first note of bar 54 (``E`` played with
finger 1), which is the conjunction. Since all the difficult sections are for
the RH, find some LH material to practice, even from a different piece of
music, in order to give the RH periodic rests by switching hands.

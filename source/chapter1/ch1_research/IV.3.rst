3. Why Is Intuition So Often Wrong?
-----------------------------------

We saw that intuitive methods are frequently wrong. This happens in most
fields, not only piano practice. The reason for this is purely statistical.
There are almost an infinite number of ways to perform any task; yet, there is
only one best way. That is, our chances of guessing the correct way is
basically zero. Nature has endowed us with “intuition” which quickly gives us a
workable solution – one which is usually better than most solutions. However,
among all possible solutions, there is only one best method. Since the
intuitive solutions are generally arrived at quickly with insufficient
information, they are seldom optimum. Therefore, your chances of hitting the
optimum method using intuition are very low.

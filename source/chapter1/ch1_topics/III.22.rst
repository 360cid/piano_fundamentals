22. Summary of Method
---------------------

This method is based on 7 major concepts: Hands Separate Practice (HS,
:ref:`II.7`), Segmental Practice (:ref:`II.6`), Relaxation (:ref:`II.10` &
:ref:`II.14`), Parallel Sets (:ref:`II.11`, :ref:`III.7.b`, :ref:`IV.2.a`),
Memorization (:ref:`III.6`), Mental Playing (:ref:`III.6` & :ref:`III.12`), and
Making Music (throughout book).

#. Learn only musical compositions, no Hanon, Czerny, etc., but Scales,
   Arpeggios, Chromatic Scale (:ref:`III.5`) are necessary. Your first piano
   should be a weighted key digital; then obtain a quality grand as soon as
   possible; donâ€™t purchase an upright unless you already have one.
#. Listen to performances and recordings for ideas to practice musically.
   Imitation cannot decrease your creativity because it is impossible to imitate
   others exactly, and ideas are priceless.
#. Practice old finished pieces cold (without warm-ups, :ref:`III.6.g`), to
   strengthen your performance skills.
#. When starting a new piece, sight read to identify difficult sections, and
   practice the most difficult sections first; then

  #. Practice HS, in overlapping Segments (Continuity Rule, :ref:`II.8`); switch
     hands frequently, every 5 seconds if necessary. All technical development
     should be done HS.
  #. Memorize first, HS, THEN start practice for technique; get up to speed as
     quickly as you can. Memorizing after you have learned to play the piece well
     does not work. Learn Mental Playing as soon as you start to memorize, and use
     it to acquire Relative/Absolute Pitch (:ref:`III.12`).
  #. Use Parallel Sets to diagnose your weaknesses; cycle (:ref:`III.2`) parallel
     sets to overcome those weaknesses and for getting up to speed quickly.
  #. Divide difficult passages into small segments that are easy to play and use
     these segments to practice for relaxation and speed.

#. Play the last repetition of any repeated practice slowly before switching
   hands or moving to a new segment, or before quitting practice.
#. Practice Relaxation at all times, especially HS; this includes the entire
   body, including Breathing and Swallowing (:ref:`II.21`).
#. Play through mistakes; do not stop to correct them because you will develop
   stuttering habits. Correct the mistakes later using segmental practice around
   each mistake.
#. Use the metronome to check the rhythm or speed briefly (typically, a few
   seconds); do not use it for "slowly ramping up speed", or for long periods
   of time (more than several minutes).
#. Use pedal only where indicated; practice without pedal until satisfactory
   HT, THEN add pedal. 
#. To learn Hands Together (:ref:`II.25`): practice HS until faster than final
   HT speed before starting HT practice. For practicing difficult passages HT,
   pick a short segment, play the more difficult hand, and progressively add
   notes of the other hand.
#. Practice musically, without forte but with firmness, authority, and
   expression. Piano practice is not finger strength exercise; it is the
   development of brain power and nerve connections for control and speed. For
   FF passages, learn relaxation, technique, and speed first, then add FF. The
   power for FF comes from the body and shoulders, not the arms.
#. Before quitting practice, play everything you just practiced slowly for
   ensuring correct Post Practice Improvement (PPI, :ref:`II.15`), which occurs
   mainly during sleep. The last thing you want for PPI is to include your
   mistakes (especially from Fast Play Degradation [:ref:`II.25`]).

4. Preparation
--------------

Prepare for tuning by removing the music stand so that the tuning pins are
accessible (grand piano). For the following section, you need no further
preparation. For "setting the bearings", you need to mute all the side strings
of the triplet strings within the "bearings octave" using the muting strip so
that when you play any note within this octave, only the center string will
vibrate. You will probably have to mute close to two octaves depending on the
tuning algorithm. Try out the entire algorithm first to determine the highest
and lowest notes you need to mute. Then mute all the notes in between. Use the
rounded end of the wire handle of the upright mute to press the felt into the
spaces between the outer strings of adjacent notes.
